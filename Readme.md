Honeycomb is a simple social networking site with general features such as a signup page, login page, logout page, personal profile, user profile picture, friend list, ability to add/remove friends, public and private messaging between users.

Honeycomb is a small project for me to practice the following techniques: 
- MySQL table creation and access
- CSS stylesheet
- Session control (PHP)
- DOM access (Javascript)
- Ajax calls
- Event & error handling
- File uploading and inclusion
- Image manipulation
